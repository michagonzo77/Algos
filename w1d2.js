Selection sort works by iterating through the list, finding the minimum
value, and moving it to the beginning of the list. Then, ignoring the first
position, which is now sorted, iterate through the list again to find the
next minimum value and move it to index 1. This continues until all values
are sorted.
Unstable sort.

Time Complexity
- Best: O(n^2) quadratic.
- Average: O(n^2) quadratic.
- Worst: O(n^2) quadratic.
Space: O(1) constant.
Selection sort is one of the slower sorts.
- ideal for: pagination, where page 1 displays 10 records for example,
you run selection sort for 10 iterations only to display the first 10
sorted items.

  - Stable sort, efficient for small data sets or mostly sorted data sets.
  Time Complexity
    - Best: O(n) linear when array is already sorted.
    - Average: O(n^2) quadratic.
    - Worst: O(n^2) quadratic when the array is reverse sorted.
  Space: O(1) constant.
  - this sort splits the array into two portions (conceptually, not literally).
  - the left portion will become sorted, the right portion
      (that hasn't been iterated over yet) is unsorted.
  can shift OR swap target element until it reaches desired position
  shifting steps:
  1. consider the first item as sorted
  2. move to the next item
  3. store current item in a temp var (to make this position available to shift items)
  4. if item to the left of current is greater than current item, shift the
      left item to the right.
  5. repeat step 4 as many times as needed
  6. insert current item
  7. move to the next item and repeat
  swap steps:
  1. consider the first item as sorted
  2. move to the next item
  4. if item to left of current item is less than current, swap
  5. repeat step 4 until item to left is less than current item
  6. move to next item and repeat
